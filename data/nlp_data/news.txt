The Yankees' reinforcements in the offseason were not as strong as they were in the past. They did not sign the four major free-market shortstops when they needed shortstops. Instead, they chose to welcome the defense-oriented Isiah Kiner-Falefa through trades. This move has aroused dissatisfaction among fans. Recently, it has been reported that Brett Gardner, a champion with 14 years of team qualifications, may be recruited by the Blue Jays, a strong competitor in the same district.
